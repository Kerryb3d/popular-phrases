# popular-phrases
Javascript function to find the most popular phrases in an input string.

### Task
Given a string representing a document, write a function which returns the top 10 most frequent
repeated phrases. A phrase is a stretch of three to ten consecutive words and cannot span
sentences. Omit a phrase if it is a subset of another, longer phrase, even if the shorter phrase
occurs more frequently (for example, if “cool and collected” and “calm cool and collected” are
repeated, do not include “cool and collected” in the returned set). A phrase is repeated if it is used
two or more times.
